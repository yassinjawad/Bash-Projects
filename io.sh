# If you want to take input from the user, you use
# the read command. This command takes the input and
# saves it into a variable.

# If you want to output something to the terminal,
# you use the echo command.

# Display a prompt to the user
echo Hello, who am I talk to?
# Read user input into a variable
read varname
# Display a message to the user that includes the
# value stored in the variable
echo It\'s nice to meet you $varname

# You can alter the behavior of read with a variety of
# command line options.
# Two commonly used options are -p which allows you
# to specify a prompt and -s which makes the input
# silent.
# This can make it easy to ask for a username and
# password combination.
read -p 'Username: ' username
read -sp 'Password: ' password

echo Thank you $username we now have your login details.

# Display prompt to user.
echo Enter filename

# read user input into variable.

# If the file exists

    echo $file exists in the directory
    # output the contents of the file
    cat $file
# If the file doesn't exist
else
    # Create the file.
